Data tables and scripts for study on peripheral blood in HIV patients infected with respiratory viruses.

About the study:
Respiratory viral (RV) infections represent a major threat for human health worldwide. Persons with HIV (PWH) have a strongly compromised immune response and are thought to be at higher risk for severe RV disease. However, very little is known about the host immune response to RV infection in PWH. Here, we investigated gene expression changes in the peripheral blood of PWH co-infected with RV and compared them to published data from non-HIV patients infected with RV only. We observed a strong differential response in non-HIV patients. However, the response in PWH was strongly dampened. Our data provides important insights into the host response to RV infections in HIV patients.
